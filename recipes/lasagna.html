    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty,
      made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more
      traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my
      mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan.
      I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and
      crusty garlic bread.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Meat:</strong> This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground
        meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Onion:</strong> A diced onion is cooked until translucent with
        the ground meat.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Fresh herbs:</strong> For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of
        parsley and crush one clove of garlic.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Noodles:</strong> Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This
        recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready
        variety to save time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cheese:</strong> The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese
        and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.
      </li>
    </ul>
